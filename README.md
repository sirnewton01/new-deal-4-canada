# Concerning a New Deal 4 Canada (ND4C)

Canada is at a cross-roads, much like its neighbour the United States. For many on both sides of the border there is a sense of unending crisis. There are so many fires and not enough hoses. People feel that the status quo is not working but are unsure what needs changing. Most politicians are offering no real hope, while the others offer a facade, which evokes baser instincts of their constituents stirring resentments.

Neither Canada nor the United States are strangers to adversity. War, rebellion and even the Great Depression tested the people and they pulled through each time by working together rather than against each other. President Franklin Roosevelt enacted The New Deal during the depression, which put people back to work and gave them the hope that they desperately needed at the time. Prime Minister [R. B. Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._B._Bennett#Bennett's_New_Deal) eventually proposed our own Canadian deal after reading an immense number of letters from impoverished people and offering up some of his own money to help people out. The Canadian deal was similar in spirit to the US New Deal, but different, because the circumstances in Canada were similar, but not the same.

A group of American politicians are currently working on another new deal to deal in an effort to counter the rise of populism and divisions in the country. It is termed the Green New Deal, although it tackles more than just environmental concerns. In their case it also proposes universal health care benefits for all citizens, which is something that Canadians have had for quite some time. Their deal also addresses deep rooted racial and gender divisions for which there are some analogs in Canada.

Any deal at the scale of an entire country would attempt to tackle some of the biggest and most urgent problems of the current day in a way that benefits everyone. It is this intense focus on "win-win" that makes the deal so great. This is in contrast with populist policies or austerity, which aim to deny benefits to some or otherwise divide people with little or no clear vision for the future. It has been a long time since the political left (or even the right) has painted a compelling picture.

In order to better understand what a New Deal 4 Canada could look like, we would first need to consider the problems facing Canadian society today. While the Green New Deal can provide us with some inspiration it is not useful to simply copy it and re-use. Canada needs its own deal that makes sense to Canadians.
