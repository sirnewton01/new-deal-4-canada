# Concerning a New Deal 4 Canada (ND4C)

Canada is at a cross-roads, much like its neighbour the United States. For many on both sides of the border there is a sense of unending crisis. There are so many fires and not enough hoses. People feel that the status quo is not working but are unsure what needs changing. Most politicians are offering no real hope, while the others offer a facade, which evokes baser instincts of their constituents stirring resentments.

Neither Canada nor the United States are strangers to adversity. War, rebellion and even the Great Depression tested the people and they pulled through each time by working together rather than against each other. President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) during the depression, which put people back to work and gave them the hope that they desperately needed at the time. Prime Minister [R. B. Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._B._Bennett#Bennett's_New_Deal) eventually proposed our own Canadian deal after reading an immense number of letters from impoverished people and offering up some of his own money to help people out. The Canadian deal was similar in spirit to the US New Deal, but different, because the circumstances in Canada were similar, but not the same.

A group of American politicians are currently working on another new deal in an effort to counter the rise of populism and divisions in the country. It is termed the Green New Deal, although it tackles more than just environmental concerns. In their case it also proposes universal health care benefits for all citizens, which is something that Canadians have had for quite some time. Their deal also addresses deep rooted racial and gender divisions for which there are some analogs in Canada.

Any deal at the scale of an entire country would attempt to tackle some of the biggest and most urgent problems of the current day in a way that benefits everyone. It is this intense focus on "win-win" that makes the deal so great. This is in contrast with populist policies or austerity, which aim to deny benefits to some or otherwise divide people with little or no clear vision for the future. It has been a long time since the political left (or even the right) has painted a compelling picture.

In order to better understand what a New Deal 4 Canada could look like, we would first need to consider the problems facing Canadian society today. While the Green New Deal can provide us with some inspiration it is not useful to simply copy it and re-use. Canada needs its own deal.

## Crisis

### Climate Change

There is now clear scientific consensus that humans are causing unprecedented climate change due to carbon emissions. The evidence is overwhelming. While Canada does not have a very large population compared to rest of the world we are in the top ten producers of carbon overall and per-capita we are nearly the worst in the world. The picture is even more grim considering that the majority of the oil produced domestically is exported abroad contributing even more carbon.

### Housing Affordability

In major Canadian cities the price of houses has become much less affordable, especially for young people. Many are deferring their decision to purchase a home. Some are taking significant financial risks in purchasing a home. People are increasingly desperate about any increase in their bills, such as for electricity or municipal taxes.

### Refugee Crisis

There is an estiated 60 million displaced people worldwide, which is a sharp increase in recent years. Some are fleeing war, others are trying to escape violence and terrible economic conditions. There has been cases of increasingly desperate attempts of migrants to escape to countries with much more stable environments. Settling of refugees has been met with increasing animosity in Northa America and Europe. For example, Germany has settled an impressive number of refugees, but with significant pains and increasing resentment.

## Circumstances

### Large Size / Low Population Density

Canada is the second largest country in the world and has has among the lowest population densities. The distances are vast and there is incredibly abundant room.

### Cold Weather

Much of Canadian climate includes very cold winters. Heating during the cold weather is not optional and energy intensive. Often the choice of heat is either carbon intensive or expensive, sometimes both.

### Universal Healthcare

Canada already enjoys universal healthcare. Unlike the US Green New Deal, there's not as much urgency in reforming the health care system.

## Opportunities

### City Building

There is so much space in Canada and such a small population that it should be possible to sustain many more people. There are many refugees who could benefit greatly from that. At a high level this seems quite possible, but how can this be accomplished while maintaining stability.

Suddenly introducing new Canadians into existing communities can be disruptive and increase the level of animosity between the them and existing citizens. This is happening lately in places like Germany. It also happened in Canada over 150 years ago when there was a sudden influx of Irish refugees fleeing the potato famine. We know that people from different backgrounds can eventually work and live together peacefully after a shaky start.

What if new Canadians were to initially live and participate in the building entirely new cities? Also, what if existing Canadians were given the same opportunity?

When the British were expanding Canada's western frontier, refugees were offered crown land patents at a very reasonable price, but with some requirements. At that time, Canada needed farmers and settlers and so the requirements included timelines where the land had to be cleared, a home built and crops grown. Labour was very intensive, but the level of skill needed wasn't very difficult to achieve.

The situation is quite different now. Populations are now more focused in urban areas. There is much more specialization and training required in many fields of employment. Vibrant cities need a wide variety of professions in order to function properly: construction workers, engineers, medical professionals, merchants, teachers, child care workers and many others. The necessary skills and training can be sometimes found among refugees while other times it can be found among Canadians. Apprenticeship programs can help dto develop the skills with on the job training. The idea is to help people from different backgrounds to work together towards a common goal. A motivation for a new Canadian might be to have a home and a career in a safe place. Existing Canadians might be motivated by the prospect of owning their own home and having fruitful employment that pays the bills and offers them better hope than the alternative.

A modern equivalent of the crown land patent might be to offer very reasonably priced homes with the requirement that the patentee devote a specified number of years employed in the building or maintenance of the new city where they reside. After that time they could choose to sell their share and move onto whatever opportunities they like.
